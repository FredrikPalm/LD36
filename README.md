Simple survival adventure game for Ludum Dare

http://fpalm.se/ld36

The theme was Ancient Technology, so the game is vaguely set in a world where technology is primitive.

You play a family of nomads in a cold winter, trying to survive with only their deer and primitive tools.

Didn't put enough time and effort into it to make much out of the idea, unfortunately.
